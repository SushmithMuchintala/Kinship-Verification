# Kinship-Verification: Neighborhood Min Distance Descriptor for Kinship Verification
           The verification of parental and family relationships based on the facial appearance of subjects is a recent topic that attracted the attention of the computer vision research community. In this we propose a simple and effective descriptor for pairs of images, this descriptor is designed to be more robust to variations in expression.Experiments on the size of the neighborhood with various classifiers were conducted using the KinFaceW datasets, results demonstrated that this descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in five out of eight subsets of the KinFaceW and on the dataset.
